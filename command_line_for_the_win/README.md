This is a readme for the cmd challenges optional project

Here we put to use both bash commands and knowing more

about SFTP -secure file transfer protocol-, and here

are the steps I took:

1- Search about SFTP, and how it works, and its commands.

2- Establishing connection to sandbox using SFTP command.

3- navigating to the desired drectory, that I want to
put my files in.

4- using "put" command to upload files from local machine
to the sandbox machine.

5- Exiting connection using "bye" command.

6- Now will git add/commit/push from the sandbox to github
repo.
